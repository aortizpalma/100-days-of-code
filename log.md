# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: November 12, 2022 (Hangount Game with Vite-React-Typescript)

**Today's Progress**: Got game working based on WDS's tutorial

**Thoughts:** I was happy with the simplicity and practicality of Vite.js for setting up React projects and the Hangman game was a fun project to work with.
Beyond the defined React project stucture with TypeScript, coding with TypeScrit in this project wasn't really that different that doing it with JavaScript. This may be much more different in other projects.

### Day 1: November 13, 2022 (Setting up 100-days-of-code repo and plan)

**Today's Progress**: Setting up things to continue with the 100-days-of-code challenge

**Thoughts:** I'll try to keep up with the log and I'll be working on several items, such as:

- continue with a React Native project
- practice React projects, both with JS and Typescript
- practice JS, TS, Python and C# exercises
