# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: November 12, 2022 (Hangount Game with Vite-React-Typescript)

**Today's Progress**: Got game working based on WDS's tutorial

**Thoughts:** I was happy with the simplicity and practicality of Vite.js for setting up React projects and the Hangman game was a fun project to work with.
Beyond the defined React project stucture with TypeScript, coding with TypeScrit in this project wasn't really that different that doing it with JavaScript. This may be much more different in other projects.

### Day 1: November 13, 2022 (Setting up 100-days-of-code repo and plan)

**Today's Progress**: Setting up things to continue with the 100-days-of-code challenge

**Thoughts:** I'll try to keep up with the log and I'll be working on several items, such as:

- continue with a React Native project
- practice React projects, both with JS and Typescript
- practice JS, TS, Python and C# exercises

### Day 2: November 14, 2022 (Troubleshooting, updates and basic HTML refresh)

**Today's Progress**: Troubleshooting issues with Android Studio's Virtual Device Manager. Ran multiple needed software updates.
Spent time practicing basic MIMO HTML exercises on Mobile.
I found and got enrolled into a Unity Game Dev course which starts in January and lasts for 12 weeks.

**Thoughts:** I had moderate progress today but I did manage to achieve a few things:

- got Android VDM working again and running [my React Native demo :D](https://github.com/aortizpalma/100-days-of-code/blob/master/assets/AndroidVDM_working.png)
- refreshed some HTML basics
- got some necessary OS and software updates installed
- got an interesting and solid plan for progressing learning Unity and Game Dev (a bit down the road, till the Q1 2023)
